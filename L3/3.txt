;3. Define a function to tests the membership of a node in a n-tree represented as (root 
;list_of_nodes_subtree1 ... list_of_nodes_subtreen).
;Eg. tree is (a (b (c)) (d) (E (f))) and the node is "b" => true


checkExistance(l,n)
	= t, if l is an atom and l = n
	= nil, if l is an atom and l!=n
	= OR checkExistance(li, n), if li is a list
